# 1.6 Call

A function or operator call has type `Call` in KC3. To produce it
you need to quote a call to a function or operator, or you need to
evaluate a call to a cfn that itself returns a `Call`,
like `Tag.from_str`.

## 1.6.1 Examples

```elixir
ikc3> type(quote 1 + 1)
Call
ikc3> type(quote List.count(1000))
Call
```
