# 1.9 Cow

`Cow` is a copy on write data structure based on `List`.
You can call `Cow.freeze` to get a read-only value. Call it as many
times you want and each time a new writable `Tag` will be added to
the `Cow`.

## 1.9.1 Examples

```elixir
ikc3> c = cow %{a: 1, b: 2}
cow %{a: 1,
      b: 2}
```
