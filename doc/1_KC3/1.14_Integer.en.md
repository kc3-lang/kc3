# 1.14 Integer

## 1.14.1 Small integers

IKC3 supports all C integer type sizes from `U8` (matching the C type `uint8_t`)
to `U64` (matching the C type `uint64_t`) for unsigned integers,
and from `S8` to `S64` for signed integers.

In addition to these 8 basic integer types there are 2 pointer-sized
integer types :
`Uw` for unsigned pointer-sized integers,
and `Sw` for signed pointer-sized integers.

Small integers take little space, are static, they are passed directly and
not as a pointer, and for these reasons are fast.

They do not need to be cleaned after use and thus can be used in arrays like
is usually done in C.

```elixir
ikc3> type(-1)
S8
ikc3> type(-128)
S16
ikc3> type(-32768)
S32
ikc3> type(-2147483648)
S64
ikc3> type(-9223372036854775807)
S64
ikc3> type(0)
U8
ikc3> type(256)
U16
ikc3> type(65536)
U32
ikc3> type(4294967296)
U64
ikc3> type(18446744073709551615)
U64
```

## 1.14.2 Large integers

IKC3 supports large integers and they are compatible with small integers.
Their type is `Integer` and can support numbers as large as memory allows.
They are slow because they are allocated dynamically on the heap
using malloc.

```elixir
ikc3> type(1000000000000000000000000000000)
Integer
```

## 1.14.3 Operations on integers

### 1.14.3.1 Operator `~`

Binary not.

```elixir
ikc3> ~ 1
254
ikc3> ~ -1
0
ikc3> ~ 0
255
ikc3> ~ 255
0
ikc3> ~ (U16) 1
65534
ikc3> ~ (S16) 1
-2
```

### 1.14.3.2 Operator `+`

Integer addition.

All positive integers can be defined in terms of addition of :
zero or a positive integer, and one. E.g.

```elixir
1 = 0 + 1
2 = 0 + 1 + 1
3 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1
etc.
```

### 1.14.3.3 Operator `-`

Integer subtraction. Take an integer and remove another integer from it.

### 1.14.3.4 Operator `*`

Integer multiplication. Init result to zero, add an integer `a` and
repeat `b` times.

### 1.14.3.5 Operator `/`

Integer division. The inverse of multiplication :
for all integers `a` and `b` there is a couple `q` and `r` that satisfies
`a = b * q + r`. Integer division returns `q`.

### 1.14.3.6 Operator `mod`

Integer modulo. Returns `r` in the previous equation (see Operator `/`)

### 1.14.3.7 Operator `<<`

Left shift

## 1.14.4 Examples

```elixir
ikc3> type(1)
U8
ikc3> type(1000000000000000000000000000000)
Integer
ikc3> a = 1 + 100000000000000000000000000000000
100000000000000000000000000000001
ikc3> a * a
10000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000001
ikc3> a * a / 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
10000000000000
```
