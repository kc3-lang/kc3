# 1.17 Ident

The KC3 `Ident` type is an identifier. An identifier evaluates to its
bound value in the current environnement, that is in local and global
frames and then in the triple store.

To get an `Ident` you can use quote :

```elixir
ikc3> quote List.reverse
List.reverse
ikc3> type(quote List.reverse)
Ident
```
