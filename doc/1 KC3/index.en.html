        <b>KC3</b> is a programming language with meta-programmation
        and a graph database embedded into the language.
        It aims to be the language for semantic programming,
        and programming the semantic web.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently fundraising for the project to become real and
        there is a working prototype available at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://git.kmx.io/kc3-lang/kc3/">https://git.kmx.io/kc3-lang/kc3/</a>,
        please see the

      <p>KC3 is currently a programming language project, inspired by C,
        Elixir and Common Lisp. It could be described as C with Elixir
        modules, pattern matching, and a semantic object system. The
        idea is to plug modules, closures, pattern matching, a graph
        database and metaprogramming into C99 with an extremely small
        set of dependencies.
