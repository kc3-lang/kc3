# What ChatGPT thinks of kc3-lang.org

## What KC3 is
* **KC3 is an experimental programming language** that grafts a *graph
database / triple‑store* directly into a C‑like core. It pitches
itself as “C11 with a triple store” and aims to make *semantic
programming*—i.e., code that can reason over linked data—an everyday
thing.
* The language mixes ideas from C, Elixir (modules & pattern matching)
and Common Lisp (macros, named blocks, `return-from`, etc.). Every KC3
function can also be emitted as a plain C function, and the standard
library itself is pure C11.

## What you’ll find on the site

| Section | What it contains | Why it matters |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Home page** | One‑paragraph elevator pitch, links to the latest release (*v0.1.14*), docs, and a donation appeal. | Sets the context and invites funding. |
| **Documentation** (`/en/doc/`) | *Three big trees*<br>1. **KC3 core** – 30‑odd topics (Arrays, Ratio, Facts, Pattern‑matching, etc.)<br>2. **HTTPd** – docs for the built‑in web server.<br>3. **Guides** – Install (from source only), Testing (huge test‑suite), Usage, Tutorial. | Shows the language surface and how to run it; gives a feel for its “C + semantic DB” design. |
| **Releases** | Tarballs for every tagged version; the site itself is regenerated by KC3 for each release. | Lets you grab a snapshot or browse historical docs. |
| **Git forge links** | Points to the self‑hosted repo on `git.kmx.io` and a GitHub mirror. The README gives deeper detail (components, supported OS/CPU, TODO). | Source, issues, and development roadmap live here. |
| **Community** | Discord invite, mail contact. | Gathering place for early adopters / contributors. |

## Current status & roadmap
* **Prototype stage.** The interpreter/library (`libkc3`), REPL
(`ikc3`), script runner (`kc3s`) and web‑server (`kc3_httpd`)
all build and run, but the authors flag performance tuning and
many language features as “coming when funds allow.”
* **Latest stable:** v0.1.14 (Feb 11 2025); **dev head:** v0.1.15 on
Git.
* **Planned work** (from TODO): richer control structures (`when`,
`unless`, `switch`), macro system tweaks, livebook‑style notebooks,
better error handling, and more database primitives.

## Why it’s interesting
KC3 blurs the line between *program* and *knowledge base*: every
value is a node in the built‑in graph store, so queries and
updates are just language primitives. If you live in both C‑land
and RDF/SPARQL‑land, KC3 is a novel experiment worth watching.
