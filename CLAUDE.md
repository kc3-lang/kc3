# Claude Code Guidelines for KC3

## Build Commands

- Always use just `make` without any pipes or filters
- Never use `| head`, `| tail`, `| grep` or any other pipe with make

## Source Files

- The `sources.mk` and `sources.sh` files are generated by `./update_sources` at project root
- Never edit these files directly - run `./update_sources` to regenerate them
- After adding new source files, run `./configure` again

## Tools

- Do not use the Grep tool - it does not work correctly. Use `grep` via Bash instead.

## Code Style

- Never add comments in code - it prevents reading
