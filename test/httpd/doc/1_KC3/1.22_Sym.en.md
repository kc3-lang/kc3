# 1.22 Sym

The KC3 type `Sym` is used everywhere in KC3. This is symbolic
computing : the triple store and data rely on interned strings
which are easy to compare for equality.

Sorting still relies on Sym's string representation so is slower
than just comparing pointers.

Symbols either start with a capital letter character, in which
case this symbol also is a package name (see Packages).
Otherwise symbols start with `:` and if the symbol string contains
reserved characters then the symbol is quoted.

## 1.22.1 Examples

```elixir
ikc3> :"123"
:123
ikc3> type(:123)
Sym
ikc3> MyModule
MyModule
ikc3> type(MyModule)
Sym
```
