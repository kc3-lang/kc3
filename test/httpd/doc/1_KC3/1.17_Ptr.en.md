# 1.17 Ptr

In KC3 there should be no use for Ptr type but it's here to stay
compatible with C's `void *` type.

You can cast from and to a pointer but be careful about correctly
chaining casts from the same type to the same type.

The only parsable pointer is the NULL pointer :

```elixir
ikc3> (Ptr) 0
(Ptr) 0
```
