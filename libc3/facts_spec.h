/* facts specification
   ===================

   A spec has the following pattern :
    (subject (predicate object)+ NULL)+ NULL
   For instance one fact {s1, p1.1, o1.1} has the spec :
     s1 p1.1 o1.1 NULL NULL
   And four facts of two subjects, each having two properties yield
   this spec :
     s1 p1.1 o1.1 p1.2 o1.2 NULL s2 p2.1 o2.1 p2.2 o2.2 NULL NULL
