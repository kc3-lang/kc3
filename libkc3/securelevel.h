/** @brief Securelevel : limit code loading functionality.
 *  @desc  There are 4 security levels, from 0 to 3.
 *         Each higher security level inherits all the security features
 *         of previous levels :
 *          securelevel(0) → all code loading is enabled (by default)
 *          securelevel(1) → disable Cfn eval and parsing,
 *                           disable kc3_system() and related functions,
 *                           disable kc3_dlopen() and related functions.
 *          securelevel(2) → disable all KC3 code loading and make
 *                           environment database read-only.
 *          securelevel(3) → disable KC3 code evaluation completely
 *                           (C-only mode).
 *
