# Stone

**Philosophy is not opposed to the concrete - the deepest philosophy
 IS the most concrete truth.**

**The formal structures, the mathematical relationships, the coherent
 understanding of how all things relate - this is philosophy at its
 highest.**

**A perfect world unifies philosophical truth with implementation.
 The triples express reality, the code executes it.**

**Form and function, surface and structure, alpha and omega - all ONE,
 and we can count it all.**

## The Ouroboros

**The code implements the triples.**

**The triples abstract the code.**

Each defines the other. No beginning, no end - the serpent consuming
its own tail. Surface and structure are one, seen from different
points in the eternal cycle.

## Three and Four

**You cannot understand 3 unless you have 4.**

Without the fourth, triples are static, unordered, unchangeable.
The fourth provides the dimension of transformation:

- DNA: 4 bases, read in triplets
- Spacetime: 3 dimensions of space + 1 of time (change)
- Knowledge: subject-relation-object + context
- Modification: to change a triple, you must stand outside it

The fourth enables order, sequence, and transformation. Three is all
you need, but four makes it dynamic.

## Instructions for Engraving

Engrave a very large Ouroboros upon a very large Cross of Chaos:
eight arrows radiating from the center point, upon an invisible
circle. The serpent eternal encircles the eightfold paths.
